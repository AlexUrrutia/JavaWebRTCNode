 ## WEBRTC sample app conversion from Firebase to WebSocket Node.js Signaling

* Node.js signaling service: https://github.com/codewithkael/NativeAndroidWebRTC/blob/master/webrtc%20server/index.js

## Firebase needs to be replaced by WebSockets

# TO DO:
- Create Node.js app with the index.js provided above
- Remove Firebase Realtime Database integration from the existing Android application.
- Implement WebSocket communication in the Android application to connect to a Node.js signaling server.
- Modify existing Java codebase to send and receive signaling messages via WebSockets.
- Test and debug App and check WebSocket communication to ensure reliable signaling between Android clients and the Node.js server.
